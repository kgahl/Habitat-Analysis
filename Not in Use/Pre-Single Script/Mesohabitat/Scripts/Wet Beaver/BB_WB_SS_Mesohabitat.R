##Model Results
  #if pool is your reference level and the slope for riffle is significantly positive 
  #then the fish are selecting for riffle more strongly than pools. And if the slope of 
  #run is negative that means that fish are avoiding runs more than pools. If none of 
  #your slopes are significant, it means there is no difference in the relative selection 
  #strength across mesohabitats (i.e., there is no difference in selection between pools 
  #and riffles and pools and runs).
